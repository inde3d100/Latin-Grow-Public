## What is Latin Grow?
Latin Grow is a movement. When someone asks me if it is mine, the answer is that everyone who is going through the dance education "Rhythm and Body" or is interested in Salsa Social Dancing, good music, pure communication, and has a will for growth in the art of social dancing, is the owner and representative.

Latin Grow organizes events (such as festivals and parties) focused on growth first and fun later because we believe that if a dancer knows what they are doing, they will have more fun later. Latin Grow is a process. Latin Grow represents the bigger picture, and Rhythm and Body is the social dance education.

Latin Grow aims to create a hub in every city where it is introduced, so that students in that city, through a 4-year education, could practice salsa as a second profession by forwarding the correct information for the fastest growth of their students. This way, the salsa social dancer will grow automatically. On a smaller scale, all the cities must be attended to separately, with developed strategies and tactics to accommodate specifics in each city. Latin Grow is not a school on its own; it is part of another school. This is because Latin Grow skips the step of starting from zero as the owner of a certain school and handling finances, books, etc.

Latin Grow holds the strong opinion that SALSA is what every Latin social dancer should learn first, as it consists of a huge number of rhythms, styles, and music. Eventually, if a dancer starts with salsa and is interested in learning, they will be fully devoted to the proper dance education, which is salsa, and every other dance style, such as bachata, will be used just for taking a break. People who still prefer other dance styles should be in the minority; SALSA is not for everyone.

==The most important ideas in the text about the Latin Grow movement are as follows:==

1. **Inclusive Ownership**: Latin Grow is described as a collective movement, not owned by any single individual but by everyone involved in or interested in the dance education program "Rhythm and Body," Salsa Social Dancing, good music, pure communication, and personal growth within the art of social dancing.

2. **Focus on Growth and Education**: The movement prioritises growth and education in the art of social dancing over entertainment, emphasising that a deeper understanding and skill in dancing lead to greater enjoyment. It organises events like festivals and parties with this philosophy in mind.

3. **Rhythm and Body**: This program is central to Latin Grow, serving as the educational component that teaches social dance. It represents the structured approach to learning and mastering salsa and other dance forms within the movement.

4. **Creation of Local Hubs**: Latin Grow aims to establish a network of local hubs in every city it reaches, providing a 4-year educational program that could position salsa dancing as a secondary profession. This approach is intended to ensure the rapid and efficient growth of students into proficient social dancers.

5. **Tailored Strategies for Different Cities**: Recognising the unique characteristics of each location, Latin Grow plans to develop specific strategies and tactics to address the particular needs and conditions of cities individually.

6. **Integration with Existing Schools**: Instead of operating as a standalone institution, Latin Grow partners with existing schools, leveraging existing infrastructures to bypass the challenges of starting a new school from scratch, such as financial management and administrative tasks.

7. **Emphasis on Salsa**: The text strongly advocates for salsa as the foundational dance form that every Latin social dancer should learn first, due to its diverse rhythms, styles, and musical aspects. It posits that mastery of salsa will naturally lead to a comprehensive dance education, with other styles like bachata considered supplementary.

8. **Selective Appeal**: It acknowledges that salsa, while central to the movement, may not be for everyone, implying that Latin Grow is targeted toward those with a specific interest in and dedication to this style of dance.
