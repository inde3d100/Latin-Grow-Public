## Practice
Discover what type of learner you are:

- Kinesthetic
- Visual
- Combination

... and how to use that to your advantage.

### Dance
How to practice timing?
- Single Instrument: There is enough material on YouTube.
- Switching from instrument to instrument for dance enrichment.
- No basics.

Flow State:
- How can Afro beats influence our flow state?
- Removing distractions: Using headphones is the best option.
- Deliberate practice.
- Try to invent something - No basics.

### Body Movement
Three-anchor Somatic Learning Method:
1. Awareness
   - Physical
     - Point and move.
   - Mental
     - Become aware of the emotional state evoked by the music.
2. Integration
   - This is something we are already doing by combining movement in the upper and lower body. All the preparations we do consist of movements that we are not aware of. We must practice these separately to master them.

1. Practice, practice, practice. Use every opportunity.

Final Thoughts:
Learning how to dance is a process. You cannot skip any steps. For me, the process consists of:
1. Training - Showing someone how social dance works.
2. Teaching - Giving others skills of their own.
3. Inspire - Helping students envision being better than they currently are.
4. Respect the Origins - Culture, heritage, language, and history. Understand the contributions of our ancestors.
