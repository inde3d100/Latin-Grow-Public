Two decades ago, Teo stumbled upon salsa dancing by pure chance. From that moment, he knew he had found a lifelong passion. Beginning his journey in Sofia, Teo's thirst for knowledge led him to travel the world, attending countless festivals and learning from the best in the industry. His dedication took him to Milan, where he studied under the maestro Fernando Sosa of Tropical Gem, gaining invaluable insights and techniques.

Teo's teaching style reflects his belief in the uniqueness of every individual. Recognizing that each dancer has their own needs, he developed "Rhythm and Body" (RAB), a personalized methodology that promises to get novices dancing in as little as three months. By limiting class sizes, Teo ensures tailored feedback for each student, catering to auditory, kinesthetic, and visual learners. His approach contrasts with the robotic memorization seen in many dance classes. Instead, “Rhythm and Body” equips students with a repertoire of moves, encouraging them to craft their own dance stories and add their personal "spice."

Teo's impact on the salsa community extends beyond teaching. He has organized successful events like "Latin Grow" and "Salsa sin Fronteras," celebrating the essence of Latin dances rooted in Afro-Cuban traditions. Collaborating with artists from Bulgaria, Greece, and beyond, Teo has been instrumental in spreading the love for Latin dances.

Students often speak of Teo's infectious enthusiasm and his ability to turn a simple dance lesson into a transformative journey. Currently spreading his passion across Xanthi, Komotini, Alexandroupolis and Kavala, Teo has grand ambitions. In the next four years, he aims to make these cities hubs for well-prepared social dancers and instructors. His vision also includes an art center, a haven for live jazz, Latin jazz, soul, R&B, and blues performances, alongside spaces for other art forms.

Beyond the dance floor, Teo's interests are diverse. From technology and maps to reading, movies, and anime, he finds joy in various pursuits. His fondness for playing the congas has significantly influenced his dance and teaching techniques. Guided by the mantra "Will Until," Teo's journey in the world of salsa is a testament to his unwavering dedication and love for the art.
