**Rhythm and Body, educational methodology is designed to help students develop the skills and confidence they need to feel secure and enjoy dancing with anyone on the dance floor. As members of my "Buy Me a Coffee" membership program, students will have access to private online lessons as well as free face-to-face classes, which are the most important and valuable part of my teaching.** I am dedicated to providing personalised support and attention to each student as they work towards their social dance development goals.

As a dance educator, I understand that every person learns differently. Some of the challenges students face include:

- For **visual learners**, one of the most common challenges can be getting to know the instruments, such as the Clave and Congas, and how to adjust their hearing to pick up on the nuances of these rhythms and sounds.

- For those who are more **auditory learners**, it can be difficult to translate what you hear into physical movement.

With my "Rhythm and Body" methodology, I can help you develop your ability to hear and understand these important concepts, as well as connect your body to the music and develop your sense of timing and rhythm. In the private classes that are included in the membership, I will work with you personally to tailor the lessons to your individual needs and learning style, helping you to become a more confident and skilled dancer.

**As a member of my "Buy Me a Coffee" membership program, you will also have access to social dance development advice.** If you're not shy, you can send me videos of your dance practice or social dancing, and I will provide advice on the elements that, in my humble opinion, you may need to work on. This is a great option for members who want to take their dancing to the next level.
