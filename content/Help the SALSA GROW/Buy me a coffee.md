**Welcome to My Salsa World!**

Hello, beautiful people! I'm Teo, a passionate salsa dancer, instructor, and the driving force behind the Latin Grow movement. Two decades ago, I stumbled upon salsa dancing by pure chance, and from that moment, I knew I had found my lifelong passion. My journey began in Sofia, and my thirst for knowledge led me to travel the world, attending countless festivals and learning from the best in the industry. My dedication took me to Milan, where I studied under the maestro Fernando Sosa of Tropical Gem, gaining invaluable insights and techniques.

**What is Latin Grow?**

Latin Grow is more than just a movement; it's a community. It's for everyone who is going through the dance education program "Rhythm and Body" or is interested in Salsa Social Dancing, good music, pure communication, and personal growth within the art of social dancing. Latin Grow organizes events like festivals and parties focused on growth first and fun later because we believe that if a dancer knows what they are doing, they will have more fun later.

**Key Principles of Latin Grow:**

1. Inclusive Ownership: Latin Grow belongs to everyone involved in or interested in our dance education program.
2. Focus on Growth and Education: We prioritize growth and education in social dancing over mere entertainment.
3. Rhythm and Body: Our educational component that teaches social dance.
4. Creation of Local Hubs: Establishing a network of local hubs in every city we reach.
5. Tailored Strategies for Different Cities: Developing specific strategies to address the unique needs of each city.
6. Integration with Existing Schools: Partnering with existing schools to leverage their infrastructure.
7. Emphasis on Salsa: Advocating for salsa as the foundational dance form.
8. Selective Appeal: Acknowledging that salsa may not be for everyone.

**My Teaching Philosophy**

My teaching style reflects my belief in the uniqueness of every individual. Recognizing that each dancer has their own needs, I developed "Rhythm and Body" (RaB), a personalized methodology that promises to get novices dancing in as little as three months. By limiting class sizes, I ensure tailored feedback for each student, catering to auditory, kinesthetic, and visual learners. My approach contrasts with the robotic memorization seen in many dance classes. Instead, “Rhythm and Body” equips students with a repertoire of moves, encouraging them to craft their own dance stories and add their personal "spice."

**Events and Collaborations**

I've organized successful events like "Latin Grow" and "Salsa Sin Fronteras," celebrating the essence of Latin dances rooted in Afro-Cuban traditions. Collaborating with artists from Bulgaria, Greece, and beyond, I've been instrumental in spreading the love for Latin dances.

**Join Me on This Journey**

Currently spreading my passion across 4 cities (Kavala, Xanthi, Komotini, Alexandroupolis), I have grand ambitions. In the next four years, I aim to make these cities hubs for well-prepared social dancers and instructors. My vision also includes an art center, a haven for live jazz, Latin jazz, soul, R&B, and blues performances, alongside spaces for other art forms.
