- ## Obbatala
    - Obatala is an orisha in the Yoruba religion known as the "sculptor of mankind". Traditionally believed to have been tasked with creating the Earth, but failing due to intoxication with palm wine, he was instead given the responsibility of creating humans. Despite his initial failures due to his continued intoxication which led to the creation of humans with disabilities, he vowed to never drink again and reinvented himself as "The Great White God", protector of people with disabilities. In the oral traditions of Ife, the mortal Obatala founded and ruled over the city during its classical period, his successful leadership leading to his deification in the Yoruba pantheon after his death.
